# Learning Log

One entry per completed phase of the

## Phase 0 — Repository Bootstrap

### What I learned

**FastAPI** is a Python web framework for building APIs. You declare routes as ordinary
Python functions and it handles the HTTP plumbing — parsing the request, calling the
function, serializing the return value to JSON, and generating API documentation from the
type hints.

**Uvicorn** is the server that actually listens on a TCP port. FastAPI by itself never
touches the network; it is only a collection of routes and the logic to dispatch to them.
Uvicorn accepts the connection, parses the HTTP request, and hands it to FastAPI.

**ASGI** (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is the contract between those two halves.
It defines the shape of the object a server can call: roughly
`async def app(scope, receive, send)`, where `scope` describes the request, `receive` pulls
the request body, and `send` pushes the response back. Because both sides agree on that
contract, Uvicorn can be swapped for Hypercorn or Daphne without changing the application,
and FastAPI can be swapped for Starlette or Django without changing the server.

The whole request path in this phase:

```text
curl → TCP :8000 → Uvicorn → ASGI scope → FastAPI router → read_root() → dict
     → JSON encoding → HTTP 200 response → curl
```

A **route** is the pairing of an HTTP method and a path (`GET /`) with the function that
handles it. The `@app.get("/")` decorator registers `read_root` in FastAPI's routing table.

**HTTP GET** asks for a representation of a resource without changing server state. It is
safe (no side effects) and idempotent (calling it repeatedly changes nothing).

**JSON response** — returning a plain Python `dict` is enough. FastAPI serializes it and
sets `content-type: application/json` automatically.

### Why this phase was needed

Before writing any invoice logic, the development environment has to be proven to work.
If the server cannot start and return one hardcoded response, nothing built on top of it
can be trusted to fail for interesting reasons.

### What problem existed before it

An empty directory. No runnable code, no dependency list, no version control, and no
documented way for anyone else to start the project.

### New concepts

- ASGI application, and why the server/framework split exists
- Route registration via decorators
- Automatic OpenAPI schema generation and the `/docs` UI derived from it
- Pinned dependencies as a reproducibility tool
- `uv` as a venv + installer replacement when the system Python lacks `pip`

### Things I still do not fully understand

- When `async def` handlers matter versus plain `def`, and what FastAPI does differently
  for each (it runs sync handlers in a threadpool — but why, and when does that hurt?)
- What Starlette contributes versus what FastAPI adds on top of it
- How `--reload` detects changes, and why it is unsafe in production

### One architecture decision I can now explain

**Why the application does not include a database, routers, or a service layer yet.**
Each of those solves a problem that does not exist at this size. A repository layer exists
to keep SQL out of HTTP handlers — but there is no SQL. A service layer exists to give
scattered business rules a home — but there are no business rules. Adding them now would
mean writing indirection whose purpose could only be justified by pointing at a future
that hasn't arrived. The playbook's ordering is deliberate: let each layer be *earned* by a
concrete pain, so the reason for it is remembered rather than recited.

### Interview questions I should be able to answer

1. What is the difference between FastAPI and Uvicorn?
2. What is ASGI, and how does it differ from WSGI?
3. What happens, step by step, between `curl http://localhost:8000/` and the JSON response?
4. Where does the content of `/docs` come from?
5. Why pin dependency versions instead of installing whatever is latest?
6. Why is HTTP GET considered safe and idempotent?
